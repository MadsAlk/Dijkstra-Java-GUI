<h1>Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path repository! This project focuses on implementing and optimizing the classic Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for maps. Such algorithms are widely used in geographic information systems (GIS), including MapQuest and GPS-based car navigation systems.</p>

  <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The project is implemented with Java and scene builder.</li>
    <li>The program allows the user to choose the cities through mouse input or keyboard.</li>
    <li>The shortest path between the selected cities is displayed on the map.</li>
    <li>The project includes all 50 states to work with.</li>
  </ul>
